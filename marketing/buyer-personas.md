## Persona 1: Sofia — The Agency Owner

**Full Name:** Sofia Marchetti
**Age:** 42
**Location:** Milan, Italy
**Job Title:** Founder & Managing Director, Dolce Viaggi Luxury Travel
**Company Size:** 8 employees (5 travel designers, 1 admin, 2 sales)
**Annual Revenue:** ~EUR 1.2M in booking commissions
**Education:** MBA + 15 years in hospitality

### Goals
- Scale the number of itineraries her team produces without hiring more designers
- Deliver a consistently premium client experience across all designers
- Reduce the time from client brief to polished proposal (currently 4–6 hours per trip)
- Have visibility over all trips and designer workloads from a single dashboard
- Differentiate from competitors who still send PDF itineraries by email

### Pain Points
- Each designer uses their own mix of Google Docs, Sheets, and Canva — zero standardization
- No central place to see all active trips or reassign work when someone is on holiday
- Client-facing output looks different depending on which designer created it
- Manual research for hotels, activities, and transport eats up most of the planning time
- Can't measure team productivity (trips per designer, turnaround time)

### Preferred Channels
- LinkedIn (follows luxury travel industry leaders)
- Travel industry trade events (ILTM, ITB Berlin, TTG Rimini)
- Email newsletters from Skift, Travel Weekly, Phocuswire
- WhatsApp groups with other agency owners
- Google Search ("travel itinerary software for agencies")

### Buying Triggers
- Losing a client to a competitor with better visual proposals
- Peak season approaching and team can't keep up with demand
- A designer leaves and takes all their templates/know-how with them
- Seeing a competitor demo a polished digital itinerary during a trade show
- Reading a case study about AI saving 70% of planning time

### Objections
- "Will my designers actually use it, or is this another tool that collects dust?"
- "How does it integrate with our existing booking/CRM systems?"
- "I need to see ROI before committing the team to a new workflow"
- "Is client data secure? Our high-net-worth clients expect confidentiality"
- "What happens to our data if you shut down or raise prices?"

### Pain Points

- Tries the AI generation once and realizes it saves 2 hours per trip
- Gets frustrated after a weekend spent reformatting a 14-day itinerary in Google Docs
- Free tier lets him try without asking his boss for budget approval

### Objections
- "Will the AI-generated content be accurate enough, or will I spend more time fixing it?"

- "Can I customize the shared view with our agency branding?"

- Sees a competitor DMC sharing a PlanTrip-powered itinerary and asks "what tool is this?"
- Free trial lets her test with one planner before rolling out to the full team

### Objections
- "Does it work well on slow internet connections? Our team often works from remote locations"
- "Can we white-label or co-brand the shared links with our DMC logo?"
- "How do we handle multi-country trips with different suppliers per segment?"
- "We need to attach supplier confirmations and vouchers — can it do that?"
- "Our tour operator clients need to be able to modify and re-share with their end clients"
